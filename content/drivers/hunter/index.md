Our resident JZ driver, Hunter drives his Toyota-powered go kart like he's playing Assetto Corsa. He's a lover of doors and a hater of SR20. His 240sx was never blue, because "Blue is for the gays," and if you try to bully him back in chase you'll end up with a smashed in rear quarter (and he'll walk away scott-free). 

A Texas native, Hunter plays his part well in keeping the spirit of exciting grassroots motorsports alive.
